# geph5-client

`geph5-client` is the main user facing daemon. It establishes and maintains a session with the broker and chosen exits, then exposes local proxy endpoints (SOCKS5/HTTP) to tunnel user traffic through the Geph network.  The binary can optionally operate in VPN mode by tunnelling packets directly.  It also exposes a control RPC interface used by GUI frontâ€‘ends.

The client is configured with a YAML file matching the `Config` struct in `src/client.rs`.  Most fields are optional and control which services listen locally, how to reach the broker, and optional VPN or bridge settings.

Example configuration:

```yaml
socks5_listen: 127.0.0.1:9910
