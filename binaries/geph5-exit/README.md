# geph5-exit

`geph5-exit` is the server component that terminates client tunnels and forwards traffic to the open Internet.  Exits register with the broker so that clients can discover them.  Each exit enforces rate limits and may restrict access based on account level or country.

Configuration is supplied in YAML following the `ConfigFile` struct in `src/main.rs`.  The file specifies keys used to sign descriptors, how the exit connects to the broker and networking details such as listening addresses and country information.

Example configuration:

```yaml
